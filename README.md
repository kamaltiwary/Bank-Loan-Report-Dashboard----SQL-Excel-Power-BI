## 📌 Project Background  

Banking institutions deal with thousands of loan applications every month. Each loan brings:  
- **Opportunity** (interest income, cross-selling potential)  
- **Risk** (default, charge-off, fraud)  

Without proper monitoring, banks struggle to answer key questions like:  
- *Are loan applications increasing or declining?*  
- *Which segments are most profitable?*  
- *Where are the highest risks (state, employment, grade)?*  
- *How are repayments performing against funded amounts?*  

This project addresses these pain points through **data-driven dashboards** that combine SQL-based KPIs with interactive Power BI reports.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview  

I designed **3 Dashboards** for a complete analysis: 

---

### 1️⃣ SUMMARY Dashboard – **Loan Portfolio at a Glance**  
![SUMMARY Dashboard](https://github.com/KamalNayanTiwary/Bank-Loan-Report-Analysis----SQL-and-Power-BI/blob/main/Summary%20Dashboard.png)  

The **Summary Dashboard** acts as the **executive snapshot** of the bank’s loan portfolio. It is designed for senior management, risk officers, and executives who need **instant clarity** on overall performance without going into granular details.  

📊 **Key Metrics Displayed (MTD vs PMTD):**  
- **Total Loan Applications** → 38.6K overall, 4.3K this month (⏬ 6.9% MoM)  
- **Total Funded Amount** → ₹435.8M overall, ₹54.0M this month (⏬ 13.0% MoM)  
- **Total Amount Received** → ₹473.1M overall, ₹98.1M this month (⏬ 15.8% MoM)  
- **Average Interest Rate** → 12.0% portfolio average, 12.4% this month (⏫ 3.5% MoM)  
- **Average DTI** → 13.3% portfolio average, 13.7% this month (⏫ 2.7% MoM)  

🟢 **Good vs Bad Loan KPIs:**  
- Percentage of loans classified as **Good (Current, Fully Paid)** vs **Bad (Charged Off)**  
- Breakdown of Applications, Funded Amount, and Amount Received by loan quality  
- Quick assessment of **portfolio health & risk exposure**  

📑 **Loan Status Grid:**  
- Loan Count, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Avg Interest Rate, and Avg DTI  
- Split across **Current, Fully Paid, and Charged-Off** categories  
- Enables managers to see **how much of the portfolio is still active vs completed vs defaulted**  

📌 **Business Value:**  
- Provides a **single-page health check** of the loan portfolio  
- Highlights **month-over-month growth or decline** across critical KPIs  
- Helps detect **early warning signs** (e.g., decline in funded amounts, rise in interest rates)  
- Enables executives to **align lending and risk strategies** based on portfolio performance  
- Acts as a **starting point** before diving into detailed trend or borrower analysis  

📌 **Sample Insights:**  
- Loan applications dropped by **6.9%** compared to last month → suggests seasonal or market slowdown  
- Funded Amount fell faster than Applications (**13% vs 6.9%**) → indicates stricter approvals or higher risk rejection  
- Avg Interest Rate rose to **12.4%** this month → possible tightening of credit policy  
- Good Loans still dominate portfolio, but **Charged-Off loans are increasing**, requiring closer monitoring
